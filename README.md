# pyaara or Cute is a BASIC interpreter in Punjabi 

Pyaara BASIC was initialy started with a different name by @djinn at https://github.com/djinn/khhota

It is derived from https://github.com/mbutterick/beautiful-racket/ by @mbutterick and most of the 
source code is from the demos.

We believe Pyaara BASIC can become a wonderful enabler of
universal inclusion of computing resources and hence renamed it Pyaara - aka Love
