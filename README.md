# khhota (ਖੋਤਾ) or Donkey is Basic interpreter in Punjabi 
It is written in rage because people talk a lot of about programming in native language. Khhota uses [racket](https://racket-lang.org) to base the design. To install, first install racket followed by:

````console
$ raco pkg install ./khhota

````

# Demonstration Language
Khhota is designed as a demo piece implementing the minimum set of BASIC lexicon. If there is more interest, I will continue to write a full fledged interpreter


# Attribution to Beautiful Racket
This code base does not claim to be original work. In fact, it is highly derivitive taking Beautiful Racket Basic example en-masse. [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com) is an amazing read.
